      Pine martens are often known for their long, sleek bodies and shorter legs, as well as a bushy tail. These characteristics help make them formidable tree climbers and hunters. Pine martens spend the majority of their lives in the trees, jumping from branch to branch and basing their diet around other tree-dwelling animals. such as squirrels and birds. Pine martens all share narrow muzzles and triangular-like heads, but colors and fur vary among species and climates, as pine martens range almost the whole planet.
