        <p class="stalk"> <img src="PineImages/Pinehabitat.png"></img>The European Pine Marten<em> (Martes Martes)</em>,
            or just Pine Marten, is the most well
            known
            and widespread marten species. Described as cunning and agile, the European Pine Marten has quickly become a
            cornerstone of European ecology.

        <img src="PineImages/Pineappearance.png"></img>
        <p>The general appearance of the Pine Marten is similar to its North American counterparts. Pine Martens can
            reach up to 80 cm (31.5 in), with their tail being a third of said length. Their fur is dark brown with its
            signature yellow bib, and the length of the fur changes depending on the season, growing thicker in the
            winter, and shorter in the summer. The European Pine Marten is particularly skilled in tree climbing, using
            their long claws and fur between their paws to grip tree trunks and branches. They have been observed to
            twist while falling, like cats, landing on their paws when tree climbing. </p>

            <img class="face" src="PineImages/Pineprofile.png"></img>
            <p class="facetext">European Pine Martens also have a different face shape compared to its North American
                cousins across the
                Atlantic. It has a distinctively triangular face, with slimmer chhecks and shorter fur as well as its
                longer and darker snout. Its head is also shorter, with more pronounced ears jutting to the side. </p>

        <h2>Rule, Britannia!</h2>
        <p>European Pine Martens are mostly found in the UK, Scotland, more specifically. Although, they can also be
            spotted all the way from Western Europe to Norther Scandinavia and West Asia. Highly elusive, and secretive,
            the European Pine Marten is rarely spotted by visitors, their presence known mostly known through trackings
            and droppings. Pine Martens occupy mostly woodlands, but can be found on hills. Though, they prefer covered
            trees to avoid predation from Eurasian lynxes, bears, wolverines, and birds of prey.</p>

        <h2>Ecology Savior</h2>
        <p class="top">While classified as a carnivore, the European Pine Marten is known for including plants, such as
            berries,
            into their diet. Hunting small mammals and birds, as well as feeding on carrion, Pine Martens are
            opportunistic hunters and scavengers. They have even become a slight nuisance for poultry farms, using their
            agility to break into gardens and pens to hunt and steal domestic fowl and produce. </p>
        <p class="bottom">Once brough to the UK from its native home in North America, Eastern Gray Squirrels used to
            populate estates,
            but quickly escaped and began to invade neighboring ecosystems. Hoarding resources from the native Red
            Squirrels and spreading foreign diseases, the Eastern Gray Squirrel has quickly become an ecological threat
            for UK wildlife. However, unlike the Red Squirrel, which has evolved side by side with the Pine Marten, Gray
            Squirrels haven't adapted to the Pine Marten's hunting strategies. Gray Squirrels have become a bigger
            target for the Pine Marten due to its inexperience, allowing Red Squirrels to recover their populations and
            lose their competition.</p>
