    <div class="stalk">The Pacific Marten<em> (Martes Caurina)</em>, while very similar in appearance and range to the
        American Marten, is considered a completely different species. Found along the West Coast, the Pacific Marten
        has developed its own set of distinct physical and behavioral traits.

        <p class="top">
            Like its cousin, the American Marten, the Pacific Marten has a long body and short legs, covered in
            similarly-long fur. Pacific Martens can grow up to 65 cm (25.6 in) long. Their fur color also ranges in
            shade, appearing in dark brown as well as tan, and equipped with a patch of orange on its chest. Pacific
            Martens are equipped with long, thick tails and claws to easily climb trees, as well as wide paws to
            navigate across the surface of the snow.
        </p>
        <p class="bottom">At a brief glance, Pacific Martens are strinkingly similar to American Martens, and can be
            easily mistaken
            for one another. Luckily, the shape of its head is the biggest giveaway. Compared to the American Marten,
            the Pacific Marten has a longer and more narrow muzzle with a wider head and spaced out ears. It has a more
            box-shaped head, giving this species a more canine-look. </p>

            <p>The Pacific Marten is found exclusively in the Pacific Northwest, unlike its cousin, the American Marten,
                who
                has sparse populations on the East Coast. The Pacific Marten ranges from Northern California to
                Vancouver
                Island and its Pacific island neighbors. They are also found on two distinct islands in Alaksa, Kuiu and
                Admiralty Island. Uniquely, bot the Pacific Marten and the American Marten are observed to have created
                hybrid species between themselves on Kuiu Island. Pacific Martens are found in old-growth evergreen
                forests
                along the coast and higher elevations in the Rocky Mountains due to their ability to withstand the cold
                of
                the now.</p>

        <p>Due to their smaller range, Pacific Martens have a less diverse diet, depending on small mammals, usually
            squirrels and voles, alongside birds and carrion, with an occasional fish for those who live by bodies of
            water. Cannibalism isn't even off the table during the desparate seasons of starvation. Because of these
            conditions, Pacific Martens evolved to take advantage of any feeding opportunity, stealing leftovers from
            larger predators and foraging for plants that other carnivorous animals would normally dismiss. They are
            even known for stealing snacks, such as "sweet jams" from humans. </p>

        <p>Pacific Martens are born in litters of 3 or 4 during spring. While defenseless and dependant on their mother
            for their first few weeks of life, Pacific Marten kits develop quickly, having their survival skills by the
            summer, and becoming completely dependent by fall. In just two seasons, Pacific Martens leave their mother's
            territory and find their own mates by their second year. </p>
