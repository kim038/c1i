    <div class="box">The Marten With Many Names</div>
    <div class="stalk">The Beech Marten <em>(Martes Foina)</em>is no stranger to nicknames. Also known as the Stone
        Marten, House Marten, as well as the White Breasted Marten, the Beech Marten is widespread across Europe as well
        as some parts of Central Asia. Beech Martens are well known all throughout Europe and Asia, particularly due to
        being very friendly around humans all throughout their upbringing. It is common for residents to see Beech
        Martens settling nearby and kits exploring urban settlements.

        <div class="title">Appearance</div>
        <img src="BeechImages/Beechappearance.png"></img>
        <p>The Beech Marten has a pointier face than the Pine Marten, as well as rounder and shorter ears. This face
            structure makes them look more rodent-like. Beech martens have lighter and duller fur than Pine Martens, and
            instead of the signature yellow bib that other marten species have, they have a long white stripe on its
            neck,
            with brown spots. Its nose is also distinctively lighter, coming in shades of pink and gray. Like the Pine
            Marten, the Beech Marten has darker legs and tail, though its tail is slightly longer in proportion to its
            body.

    <div class="range">
        <p>Beech Martens are found all over Europe and Asia, ranging from Portugal to China. This particular species of
            marten inhabits more open landscapes and may also reside in urban structures. However, they are still known
            to
            inhabit conifer and deciduous forests. Although, compared to other marten species, they are also known for
            settling in more open landscapes, such as cliffs and fields. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="diet">
        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>Beech Martens, like other marten species, are omnivores, however, their diet contains a higher percentage of
            plants. Much of their diet has a diverse array of plants, such as blaeberries, wild tomatoes, and mountain
            ash. During the winter months when plants become more rare, Beech Martens do focus more on hunting, but
            because of their bolder nature, sometimes wander onto urban landscapes and target domestic animals.</p>
        <img src="BeechImages/Beechdiet.png">
        <p class="bottom">While this isn't part of their diet, Beech Martens, due to being strangely confident around
            human structures,
            can be found settling in and chewing on cable wires for cars, becoming quite a nuisance for vehicle owners.

        <h2>Crawl and Prowl</h2>
        <p>The Beech Marten has less fur on its paws and has shorter legs, affecting its movement patterns. While the
            Pine
            Marten moves in leaps and bounds, the Beech Marten moves more stealthily, more akin to a feline. Unlike the
            American and Pacific Marten, the Beech Marten are unable to properyl navigate through snow, instead relying
            on
            paths already made by other animals or people.</p>
