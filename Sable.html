    <div class="box">Fur Of Diamonds</div>
    <div class="stalk">The Sable <em>(Martes Zibellina)</em>is mostly known for its highly-valued fur, a commodity that
        is aligned with luxury and high-end fashion and decor. However, behind this thick fur, there is a species that
        has evolved to successfuly thrive in the forests of Russia, Mongolia, and China.
    </div>
    <div class="appearance">
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <img class="body" src="SableImages/Sableappearance.png">
        <p>Wild Sables are very monotone in color, usually coming in a few shades of brown. Some appear with the
            signature
            dark legs and tail, but they lack the bib other marten species have. Covered in thick fur, the Sable is also
            known for coming in darker shades, appearing almost black, though that color doesn't exist in the wild. Its
            overall shape and body structure resembles that of its North American cousins, likely due to the similar
            climates.</p>
        <img class="profile" src="SableImages/Sableprofile.png">
        <p>Sables have rounder faces and wider cheeks, with larger, pointier ears. Its darker appearance makes it harder
            to distinguish the head from the body, espeically due to its darker muzzle, though its long whiskers help
            mark out its snout. The colder climate also ensures longer fur on the head, though it is significantly
            shorter than the fur on its body.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="range">
        <h2>Range</h2>
        <p>The Sable is found mostly in Northern and Central Asia. Due to the snowy climates of these regions, the Sable
            is well adjusted to surviving in the snow and the cold, often found trudging in the snow and climbing trees
            and cliffs. Due to the inhospitable climate of their territory, wild Sables are seldom spotted by people.
            However, due to domestication, that doesn't exactly make them rare in population.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="variant">
        <h2>Domestication</h2>
        <img src="SableImages/Sablevariant.png">
        <p>Sables are unusually friendly towards humans despite their reclusive and hostile environment, known for being
            easily domesticated even when brought up in the wild. However, human intervention is displayed at its
            highest through selective breeding. While wild Sables are born with dark brown fur, domesticated Sables can
            be bred to have black fur, a trait that wouldn't be found in wild martens. However, the wild colors don't
            stop there. Demand and human curiosity has led to more patterns and colors, such as tuxedo. Interestingly,
            the Sable is treated like a cat or a dog, in a sense that their genetics are easily manipulated by humans
            and brought up as pets. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="fur">
        <h2>True Worth</h2>
        <p>As Sables are treated as domesticated animals, that unfortunately means that some are farmed like cattle.
            Their fur, which is known for being luxuriously thick and coming in tempting colors, are popular when it
            comes to making fur coats or other clothing. Sable fur is treated as a symbol of high status since one
            authentic article of clothing containing it can cost up to a couple thousand dollars. Some people look down
            on this practice due to the cruel nature of Sable farms, and some Sables are rescued from such conditions
            and live out the rest of their lives as companions rather than clothes.</p>
