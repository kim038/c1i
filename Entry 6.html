<h1>The Yellow-Throated Marten</h1>
<p>
    The Yellow-Throated Marten, (Martes flavigula), is known through its distinctively golden and black fur. The
    Yellow-Throated Marten can be found from Central to East, and Southeast Asia, though they're most well known in the
    Himalyan region.

<h2>
    The Golden Child
</h2>
<p>
    The Yellow-Throated Marten is the largest marten species, and is known for its powerful, physical build. It has a
    black head and a white chin, with a predominantly yellow body, accompanies by black legs and a tail. Yellow-Throated
    Martens have a distinctly wide head, and the white chin only makes the face look more dense. Fixed with rounded ears
    on the sides of its head, the Yellow-Throated Marten has a face that looks alike to its cousin, the badger.
<h2>
    Behavior
</h2>
<p>
    The Yellow-Throated Marten is known for being particularly fearless of people. A bold predator, the Yellow-Throated
    Marten can be commonly seen hunting larger prey, which is how it recieved its reputation as a ferocious species.
    Targeting small derr, pheasants, and even red pandas if given the chance, the Yellow-Throated Marten is no stranger
    to fighting its own prey.
