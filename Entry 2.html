    <h1> The American Marten</h1> 
  <p> 
    The American Marten (martes americana) are found in North America, primarily in Alaska, Canada, and the American Pacific Northwest. Preferring colder climates, the American Marten spends mcuh of its time in boreal forests, consisting of evergreen trees that can shelter and conceal them from predators and prey in the winter months.
  </p>
  <p> 
    There are two distinct looks for the American Marten. One looks very similar to the European Marten; mostly brown with darker legs and tail and a yellow bib with a narrow muzzle and head. While the other look also shares a dark brown body and yellow bib, its head is distinctly pale, almost white, contrasting with the rest of its body. Its head is also more square, with a slightly wider muzzle. While they may appear similar to European Pine Martens, American Martens have thicker fur due to their colder climates and bitter winters.

    Habitat
  </h2>
    <p>
      American Martens are found along the western regions of North America, but prefer territory that has an abundance of pine and fir trees, tree species that are integral to their survival, acting as a mode of transportation as well as their den.
    </p>
  <h2>
    Behavior
  </h2>
    <p>
      American Martens spend much of their time in the trees, navigating through the treetops in rapid strides and zigziags. However, they are also mobile on land and in water. Because American Martens don't hibernate, their bodies adapt to acclimate with the changing climate and weather. Growing thicker fur, American Martens are able to withstand the cold and easily traverse through the snow thanks to the fur between their paws.

    <h2>
      Diet
    </h2>
    <p>
      The American Marten's diet consists of almost any small animal, ranging from squirrels, voles, and fish. They also exhibit scanvenger behavior and are known to also feed on carrion. 
    </p>
    <h2>
      Same Look, Different Name
    </h2>
    <p>
      American Martens and Pine Martens are term used interchangeably when describing the North American species, as both are very visually similar. However, "American Marten" or "American Pine Marten" is the more accurate term, as the term "Pine Marten" is usually used to describe its European counterpart.
