  <h1>The Beech Marten</h1>
  <p>
    The Beech Marten, (Martes foina), is another species of marten found in Europe and Asia. 
  </p>
  <h2>
    Appearance
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Beech Marten, also known as the Stone Marten, has a pointier face than the Pine Marten, with rounder and shorter ears. This face structure makes them look more rodent-like. Beech Martens have lighter and duller fur than Pine Martens, and instead of a yellow bib, it has a long white collar on its neck, with brown spots in the center, making it look more like a stripe in some cases. Its nose is also distinctively lighter, coming in shades of pink and gray. Like the Pine Marten, the Beech Marten has darker legs and tail, though its tail is slightly longer. 
  </p>
  <h2>Range</h2>
  <p>
    Beech Martens are found all over Europe and Asia, ranging from Portugal to China. This particular species of marten inhabits more open landscapes and may also reside in urban structures. However, they still are still known to inhabit conifer and deciduous forests.

  <h2>
    Behavior
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Beech Marten has less fur on its paws and has shorter legs, affecting its movement patterns. While the Pine Marten moves in leaps, the Beech Marten moves more stealthily, more akin to a feline. Unlike the American Marten, the Beech Marten are unable to properly navigate through the snow, instead relying on paths already made by other animals or even people.   </p>
 <h2>Development
 </h2>
 <p>
Beech Martens are born into litters of around 4, cared only by their mothers. Developing quickly, Beech Marten kits become fully independent at 1 year.
