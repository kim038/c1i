        <div class="stalk">The Japanese Marten <em>(Martes Melampus)</em>is found exclusively in Japan. Covered in
            honey-colored fur, the Japanese Marten is known for its role in dispersing seeds and controlling prey
            populations. Japanese Martens are able to thrive in the harsh conditions of Japanese wilderness due to their
            thick pelt, which is how they became well known throughout the nation.</div>

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <img class="body" src="JapanImages/japaneselook.png">
        <p>Japanese Martens are known for their unique coloring and patterns. While the dominance of yellow is also seen
            in the Yellow-Throated Marten, the Japanese Marten is unique because of the thickness of its pelt and the
            softness of its colors. Because of the colder climate of Japan in the winter seasons, the Japanese Marten
            has longer fur compared to its other yellow-furred cousin, with short legs and a bushy tail. Like other
            marten species, the Japanese Marten has shorter legs, but is built with a longer body that helps it skim
            over its territory.</p>
        <img class="profile" src="JapanImages/japaneseprofile.png">
        <p>The Japanese Marten is similar in appearance to the American Marten, likely due to the similarities in their
            climates. Like the American Marten, the Japanese Marten has a rounder face and ears with softer features. It
            has a shorter muzzle and thicker fur on its head, with lighter colors and markings that distinguishes it
            from the rest of its body. Additionally, it has dark whiskers that help it navigate through the terrain.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="range">
        <h2>Range</h2>
        <p>The Japanese Marten has the smallest range of all the marten species, being only found in Japan and its
            neighboring islands. Japanese Martens prefer to find territory in old-growth forests with plentiful trees
            and undergrowth that can offer potential nesting sights and prey.</p>

        <h2>Friend or Foe</h2>
        <p>The Japanese Marten, like other marten species, is a fierce predator and has the important role in its
            ecology as pest control, preying on small mammals that may damage plants that litter the forest floors of
            Japan. However, despite this incredibly important role, the Japanese Marten has made a few enemies from its
            scavenging, feeding on animals beneficial to human activity, such as agriculture. </p>

        <h2>Variants</h2>
        <p class="text1">Despite having a uniformed look, there is some room for variations when it comes to the
            Japanese Marten. While the difference are less drastic than those of the American Marten or the Sable, the
            different marbling and patterns are still a sight to behold. Some Japanese Martens contain more yellow,
            ditching the dark brown stockings altogether, while others seem to embrace it, having half of their bodies
            covered in brown fur. There are always new looks when it comes to martens, even when it seems so simple.</p>
