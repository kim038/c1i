        <div class="stalk">The <span style="font-weight: 600;">American Marten</span> <em>(Martes Americana)</em> is one
            of
            the two marten species
            found in North
            America. Found primarily in Alaska, Canada, and the Pacific Northwest, the American Marten evolved to thrive
            in the cold and dense forests and hills of the north. Incredibly elusive, one must weather through the
            intense
            climates to witness one of these weasels.
            <p class="treet">
                There
                are
                several subspecies under the American Marten name, ranging across from the West to the East Coast, from
                the Newfoundland Marten to the Preble Marten. The American Marten is under threat of poaching and
                habitat loss, especially old-growth
                forests, which
                take centuries to grow and mature. However, conservation efforts help restore and protect certain parts
                of these regions, ensuring that there are some pieces of territory left for these elusive creatures.
                The American Marten is not considered endangered, and is only classified as least concern.
                However, precautions must still be taken, as their population numbers are still dwindling under
                environmetal stress.

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <img class="side" alt="american marten profile" src="Images/Alook.png"></img>
        <p>American Martens, like the rest of the Mustelidae family, are known for its lengthy body and short legs,
            reaching up to 76 cm (30 in), while only reaching 15 cm (6 in) in height. They are covered with thick,
            brown
            fur, with darker legs and tail. A distinct physical trait of the American Marten, and martens in
            general, is
            its iconic yellow spot on its chest, resembling a bib. Since much of their life is spent in the trees,
            American Martens have semi-retractable claws that allow them to easily dig into the bark and skim the
            treetops. </p>
        <p>The American Marten has a box-shaped head, with wider cheeks and ears. Its muzzle is quite narrow
            compared to the size of its head, and is covered with dark whiskers that help it hunt. Its fur grows
            significantly thicker during the winter months to help it keep warm, which is why its pelt was often
            used as clothing for indigenous populations during the fur trade.</p>

        </div>
        <p>There are two distinct lookds for the American Marten. One looks very similar to the European Marten;
            mostly
            brown with a narrow muzzle and head. Meanwhile, the lighter variant, while sharing the same dark brown
            body,
            has a distinctly pale head, almost white, contrasting with the rest of its body, and a slightly wider
            muzzle
            and head. The lighter variant is the most well-known of the two beacuse of its unique contrast in color
            and
            its overall similarity in appearance to a domesticated house pet.</p>

        <p>The heavy snowfall of the northern regions of North America can be a hinderance for many animals, sinking
            them several feet. However, the Ameriacn Marten evolved to bypass the snow, growing thick fur between
            their
            paws, acting as a crude form of shoeshoes. This allows the American Marten to easily skim over the snow
            and
            essentially float over the surface.

            <h2>Monsters of the North</h2>
            <p class="habitat">American Martens are found primarily on the West Coast, more specifically the Pacific
                Northwest.
                This includes
                British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Northern California, and even Montana and Idaho. These regions are
                populated with old-growth coniferous forests that are used as shelter and trasportation throughout the
                year.

        <p>The American Marten is primarily carnivorous, however, they are also known to be opportunistic, feeding
            on
            anything edible, from small mammals, birds, insects, reptiles, eggs, fish, carrion, and fruit. Their diet is
            more
            diverse during the warmer seasons, when there are more options. Plants become more plentiful and
            nutritionally valuable, such as berries. However, during the winter monrths, when plants shrivel and
            prey
            begins to migrate, the American Marten relies more on meat, and are prepared to chase and hunt as long
            as
            they can eat at the end of the day, becoming vicious hunters. This becomes a shock, however, for
            unfortunate
            onlookers, as it may seem like a cruel joke by nature that what appears to be a "cute" animal is
            equipped
            with knoves for teeth and claws, and an appetite for the hunt.</p>

        <h1>America's Tree Hunters</h1>
        <p>American Martens spend much of their time in the trees, navigating through the treetops in rapid strides and
            zigzags. However, they are also mobile on land and in water, though they avoid to demonstrate such skills
            when they can. Since majority of their lives are spent in the trees, they've adapted to become on the most
            experienced and skilled tree hunteres and climbers in North America.
            Since American Martens don't hibernate nor migrate during the winter, they bodies adapt to the changing
            temperature and climate, growing winter fur that helps them remain warm and also assist them during hunts.

            <em>(Pinus
                Contorta)</em> is
            one of the many coniferous tree species
            in the Pacific Northwest that the American Marten uses to survive. Also known as the Lodgepole Pine, the
            tree is mostly found along the coast in North America, and is rather small compared to its cousins in
            the
            coniferous family tree, growing up to only 9 m <em>(30 ft)</em> tall. However, even with this rather
            small
            size, it offers brief, but useful, shelter from predators, and a bountiful source of prey.

            Douglas Fir
            Tree
            <em>(Pseudotsuga Menziesii)</em> are one of the most valuable trees in North America, making up much of its
            old-growth forest populations. Growing up to 76 m<em> (250 ft)</em> tall, the Douglas Fir Tree is integral
            to the survival of the American Marten. Both the Coast and the Rocky Mountain Douglas Fir are used by the
            American Marten. Its tall height allows martens to scope out the forest and protect them from predators,
            such as eagles, wolves, and bears. Its thick trunk also offers useful shelter for the American Marten,
            acting as its den.

    <div class="final">
        <p>Despite their bold hunting patterns, Ameriacn Martens are incredibly reclusive and shy with
            each
            other and with
            humans, only interacting with each other martens during combate and mating season. They are rarely spotted
            by
            people, hardly venturing out of their territory. Their exterior fools many people, but American Martens are
            always quick to remind everyone they're in the Mustelid family, one of the most unassuming, yet vicious,
            species
            on the planet. Even the frigid lands of the north aren't enough to temper these beasts, instead equipping
            them
            with skills and instincts that make them one of the most fericious animals in North America, at least for
            its
            size.</p>
