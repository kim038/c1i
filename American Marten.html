        <div class="stalk">The <span style="font-weight: 600;">American Marten</span> <em>(Martes Americana)</em> is one
            of
            the two marten species
            found in North
            America. Found primarily in Alaska, Canada, and the Pacific Northwest, the American Marten evolved to thrive
            in the cold and dense forests and hills of the north. Incredibly elusive, one must weather through the
            intense
            climates to witness one of these weasels.
            <p class="treet">
                There
                are
                several subspecies under the American Marten name, ranging across from the West to the East Coast, from
                the Newfoundland Marten to the Preble Marten. The American Marten is under threat of poaching and
                habitat loss, especially old-growth
                forests, which
                take centuries to grow and mature. However, conservation efforts help restore and protect certain parts
                of these regions, ensuring that there are some pieces of territory left for these elusive creatures.
                The American Marten is not considered endangered, and is only classified as least concern.
                However, precautions must still be taken, as their population numbers are still dwindling under
                environmetal stress.

        <h2>APPEARANCE</h2>
        <img class="side" alt="american marten profile" src="Images/Alook.png"></img>
        <p>American Martens, like the rest of the Mustelidae family, are known for its lengthy body and short legs,
            reaching up to 76 cm (30 in), while only reaching 15 cm (6 in) in height. They are covered with thick,
            brown
            fur, with darker legs and tail. A distinct physical trait of the American Marten, and martens in
            general, is
            its iconic yellow spot on its chest, resembling a bib. Since much of their life is spent in the trees,
            American Martens have semi-retractable claws that allow them to easily dig into the bark and skim the
            treetops. </p>
        <p>The American Marten has a box-shaped head, with wider cheeks and ears. Its muzzle is quite narrow
            compared to the size of its head, and is covered with dark whiskers that help it hunt. Its fur grows
            significantly thicker during the winter months to help it keep warm, which is why its pelt was often
            used as clothing for indigenous populations during the fur trade.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>There are two distinct lookds for the American Marten. One looks very similar to the European Marten;
            mostly
            brown with a narrow muzzle and head. Meanwhile, the lighter variant, while sharing the same dark brown
            body,
            has a distinctly pale head, almost white, contrasting with the rest of its body, and a slightly wider
            muzzle
            and head. The lighter variant is the most well-known of the two beacuse of its unique contrast in color
            and
            its overall similarity in appearance to a domesticated house pet.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The heavy snowfall of the northern regions of North America can be a hinderance for many animals, sinking
            them several feet. However, the Ameriacn Marten evolved to bypass the snow, growing thick fur between
            their
            paws, acting as a crude form of shoeshoes. This allows the American Marten to easily skim over the snow
            and
            essentially float over the surface.

            <h2>HUNTERS OF THE NORTH</h2>
            <p> American Martens are found primarily on the West Coast, more specifically the Pacific
                Northwest.
                This includes British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Northern California, and even Montana and Idaho.
                These regions are populated with old-growth coniferous forests that are used as shelter and
                transportation throughout the year.

                FIERCEST
                PREDATOR</span>
        </h1>
        <img class="hunt" alt="marten hunting hare" src="Images/Ahunt.png"></img>
        <p>The American Marten is primarily carnivorous, however, they are also known to be opportunistic, eating
            anything edible, from small mammals, birds, eggs, fish, carrion, and fruit. Their diet is more diverse
            during the warmer seasons, as plants become more plentiful and nurtitionally valuable. However, during the
            winter months, when plans shrivel and animals migrate, the American Marten relies more on meat, becoming
            vicious hunters. This becomes a shock, however, for unfortunate onlookers, as it may seem like a cruel joke
            by nature that what appears to be a "cute" animal is equipped with knives for teeth and claws, and an
            appetite for the hunt.</p>
        <p class="text">There is quite a radical difference in the diet of the American Marten between the summer and
            winter months. In fact, the US Forest Services conducted a research project documenting its food sources
            between the seasons.

        <h1>AMERICA'S TREE HUNTERS</h1>
        <img class="branch" src="Images/Abranch.png"></img>
        <p>American Martens spend much of their time in the trees, navigating through the treetops in rapid strides and
            zigzags. However, they are also mobile on land and in water, though they avoid to demonstrate such skills
            when they can. Since majority of their lives are spent above the ground and in the trees, they've adapted to
            become one of the
            most experienced and skilled tree hunters and climbers in North America, rivalring their own prey, the
            squirrel. Since American Martens don't hibernate during the winter, their bodies adapt to the changing
            temperatures and climates, growing winter fur that helps them remain warm and also assist them during hunts.
        </p>
        <p class="text">Despite their bold hunting patterns, American Martens are incredibly reclusive and shy with each
            other, and
            to humans, only interacting with other martens during combat and mating season. They are rarely spotted by
            people, hardly venturing out of their territory.</p>

            <p>The Shore Pine Tree <em>(Pinus Contorta)</em> is one of the many coniferous tree species in the Pacific
                Northwest that the American Marten uses to survvive. Also known as the Lodgepole Pine, the tree is
                mostly found along the coast in North America, and is rather small compared to its cousins, growing up
                to only 9 m (30 ft) tall. However, even with thsi rather small size, it offers brief, but useful shelter
                from predators, and a bountiful source of prey.</p>

            <h1>Douglas Fir Tree</h1>
            <p>The Douglas Fir Tree <em>(Pseudotsuga Menziesii)</em> are one of the most valuable trees in North
                America, making up much of its old-growth forest populations. Growing up to 76 m (250 ft) tall, the
                Douglas Fir Tree is integral to the survival of the American Marten. Both the Coast Douglas Fir and the
                Rocky Mountain Douglas Fir are used by the American Marten. Its tall height allows the martens to scope
                out the forest and protect them from predators, such as eagles, wolves, and bears. Its thick trunk also
                offers useful shelter for the American Marten, acting as its den.</p>
