        <div class="stalk">The <span style="font-weight: 600;">American Marten</span> <em>(Martes Americana)</em> is one
            of
            the two marten species
            found in North
            America. Found primarily in Alaska, Canada, and the Pacific Northwest, the American Marten evolved to thrive
            in the cold and dense forests and hills of the north. Incredibly elusive, one must weather through the
            intense
            climates to witness one of these weasels.
            <p class="treet">
                There
                are
                several subspecies under the American Marten name, ranging across from the West to the East Coast, from
                the Newfoundland Marten to the Preble Marten. The American Marten is under threat of poaching and
                habitat loss, especially old-growth
                forests, which
                take centuries to grow and mature. However, conservation efforts help restore and protect certain parts
                of these regions, ensuring that there are some pieces of territory left for these elusive creatures.

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <img class="side" alt="american marten profile" src="Images/Alook.png"></img>
        <p>American Martens, like the rest of the Mustelidae family, are known for its lengthy body and short legs,
            reaching up to 76 cm (30 in), while only reaching 15 cm (6 in) in height. They are covered with thick,
            brown
            fur, with darker legs and tail. A distinct physical trait of the American Marten, and martens in
            general, is
            its iconic yellow spot on its chest, resembling a bib. Since much of their life is spent in the trees,
            American Martens have semi-retractable claws that allow them to easily dig into the bark and skim the
            treetops. </p>
        <p>The American Marten has a box-shaped head, with wider cheeks and ears. Its muzzle is quite narrow
            compared to the size of its head, and is covered with dark whiskers that help it hunt. Its fur grows
            significantly thicker during the winter months to help it keep warm, which is why its pelt was often
            used as clothing for indigenous populations during the fur trade.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>There are two distinct lookds for the American Marten. One looks very similar to the European Marten;
            mostly
            brown with a narrow muzzle and head. Meanwhile, the lighter variant, while sharing the same dark brown
            body,
            has a distinctly pale head, almost white, contrasting with the rest of its body, and a slightly wider
            muzzle
            and head. The lighter variant is the most well-known of the two beacuse of its unique contrast in color
            and
            its overall similarity in appearance to a domesticated house pet.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The heavy snowfall of the northern regions of North America can be a hinderance for many animals, sinking
            them several feet. However, the Ameriacn Marten evolved to bypass the snow, growing thick fur between
            their
            paws, acting as a crude form of shoeshoes. This allows the American Marten to easily skim over the snow
            and
            essentially float over the surface.
        </p>

    <div class="range">
        <h1>Range</h1>
        <p class="habitat">American Martens are found primarily on the West Coast, more specifically the Pacific
            Northwest.
            This includes
            British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Northern California, and even Montana and Idaho. These regions are
            populated with old-growth coniferous forests that are used as shelter and trasportation throughout the
            year.

            <h1>Diet
            </h1>
            <p>The American Marten is primarily carnivorous, however, they are also known to be opportunistic,
                feeding
                on
                anything edible, from small mammals, birds, insects, reptiles, eggs, fish, carrion, and fruit. Their
                diet is
                more
                diverse during the warmer seasons, when there are more options. Plants become more plentiful and
                nutritionally valuable, such as berries. However, during the winter monrths, when plants shrivel and
                prey
                begins to migrate, the American Marten relies more on meat, and are prepared to chase and hunt as
                long
                as
                they can eat at the end of the day, becoming vicious hunters. This becomes a shock, however, for
                unfortunate
                onlookers, as it may seem like a cruel joke by nature that what appears to be a "cute" animal is
                equipped
                with knoves for teeth and claws, and an appetite for the hunt.</p>

        <h1>America's Tree Hunters</h1>
        <p>American Martens spend much of their time in the trees, navigating through the treetops in rapid strides
            and
            zigzags. However, they are also mobile on land and in water, though they avoid to demonstrate such
            skills
            when they can. Since majority of their lives are spent in the trees, they've adapted to become on the
            most
            experienced and skilled tree hunteres and climbers in North America.
            Since American Martens don't hibernate nor migrate during the winter, they bodies adapt to the changing
            temperature and climate, growing winter fur that helps them remain warm and also assist them during
            hunts.
