      The Pacific Marten (Martes Caurina), while very similar in appearance to American Martens, are considered a completely different species. With slight differences in range and appearance, the Pacific Marten has its own set of distinct traits.

      Like its cousin the American Marten, the Pacific Marten comes in two distinct variations, a lighter and darker color. To make things more difficult, both species are approximately the same size, ranging from 48-65 cm. If an onlooker were to briefyl glance at one, they could easily mistake it for an American Marten. Classifying the Pacific Marten primarily off its colors is a difficult task. Luckily, the shape of its head is its biggest give away. Compared to the American Marten, the Pacific Marten has a longer and more narrow muzzle with a wider head and spaced out ears, with a more box-like head, giving this species a more canine-look.
