      The Pacific Marten (Martes Caurina), while very similar in appearance to American Martens, are considered a completely different species. With slight differences in range and appearance, the Pacific Marten has its own set of distinct traits.

      Appearance
    </h1>
    <p>
      Like its cousin the American Marten, the Pacific Marten comes in two distinct variations, a lighter and darker color with a yellow bib. To make things more difficult, both species are approximately the same size, ranging from 48-65 cm. If an onlooker were to briefyl glance at one, they could easily mistake it for an American Marten. Classifying the Pacific Marten primarily off its colors is a difficult task. Luckily, the shape of its head is its biggest give away. Compared to the American Marten, the Pacific Marten has a longer and more narrow muzzle with a wider head and spaced out ears, with a more box-like head, giving this species a more canine-look. Pacific Martens are equipped with long, thick tails and claws to easily climb trees, and wide paws to navigate across the surface of the snow like its cousin.

      The Pacific Marten is found exclusively in the Pacific Northwest, from Northern California to the Vancouver Island and its Pacific island neighbors. Pacific Martens are also found on two distinct islands of Alaska, Kuiu and Admiralty Island. Uniquely, both the Pacific Marten and American Marten are observed to be creating a hybrid species between themselves on Kuiu Island. Pacific Martens are found in old-growth evergreen forests along the coast and higher elevations in the Rocky Mountains due to their ability to withstand the cold of the snow.

      Due to their smaller range compared to the American Marten, Pacific Martens' diet is less diverse, depending on small mammals, usually squirrels and voles, alongside birds and carrion, with an occasional fish for those who live by bodies of water. Cannibalism isn't even off the table during the bitter months of starvation. Because of these conditions, Pacific Martens evolved to take advantage of any feeding opportunity, stealing left overs from larger predators and foraging for plants that other carnivorous animals would normally dismiss. Even they're not above stealing snacks from humans.

      Pacific Martens are born in litters of 3 or 4 during spring. While defenseless and dependant to their mother for their first few weeks of life, Pacific Marten kits develop quickly, developing their survival skills by summer, and independent by fall. In just two seasons, Pacific Martens leave their mother's territory and find their own mates by their second year.
