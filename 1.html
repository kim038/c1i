      Natural British Columbia</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p> style="font family: Helvetica">
        British Columbia is both in the American Northwest and the Canadian Southwest. It houses many unique flora and fauna that are exclusive to the Pacific Norhwest and Coast, ranging from Canada's only desert to temperal rainforests. Much of British Columbia's lanscapes are well known and adored, but the hidden intricacies are often left unknown. Everyone knows Vanouver Island and its dense forests, but what about the subtle adaptations of the animals on the coast? There is more beyond the surface of this splendid province.

      The Pacific Coast</h2>
      <p> style="font family: Helvetica">
        British Columbia is Canada's only province that touches the Pacific Ocean. Yukon Territory should also count, but the American state of Alaska takes up the remaining sliver of the Pacific Coast, leaving Yukon land-locked. The Pacific Coast is an iconic part of the British Columbia, housing many unique flora and fauna, and also fuelling local urban legends and hoaxes.

      The Pacific Tree Octopus</h3>
    <p> style="font family: Helvetica">
    To understand the Pacific Tree Octopus, one must know about its cousin, the Giant Pacific Octopus. Unlike its tree-dwelling kin, this octopus lives its entire life in the ocean, is almost twices the size, and is, most importantly, real. The Pacific Tree Octopus was an internet hoax created in the 90s that captured the minds of many who were new to the internet. While the existence of the tree octopus was fabricated, its real counterpart is still thriving by the coast. These interesting specimens are highly intelligent and are known to interact with living beings, proving to be just as interesting as its fictional cousin.

    <h3>Rocky Shores</h3>
    <p> style="font family: Helvetica">
      With the tides of the Pacific Ocean, much of its marine life can be found in both its waters and the rocky shore.
