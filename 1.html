    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p> 
        Pine martens (Martes martes) are a part of the mustelid family, which includes familiar animals such as ferrets, stoats, and wolverines. These animals are well known for their long bodies and short legs, commonly called weasels. While often dismissed as pests, animals in the mustelid family showcase a wide variety of characteristics and skills that make them a worthwhile case to study.

      Pine martens are often known for their long, sleek bodies and shorter legs, as well as a bushy tail. These characteristics help make them formidable tree climbers and hunters. Pine martens spend the majority of their lives in the trees, jumping from branch to branch and basing their diet around other tree-dwelling animals. such as squirrels and birds. Pine martens all share narrow muzzles and triangular-like heads, but colors and fur vary among species and climates, as pine martens range almost the whole planet.

    There are two distinct looks for the American Marten. One looks very similar to the European Marten; mostly brown with darker legs and tail and a yellow bib with a narrow muzzle and head. The other look is different. While it also shares a dark brown body and yellow bib, its head is distinctly pale, almost white, contrasting with the rest of its body. Its head is also more square, with a slightly wider muzzle.
