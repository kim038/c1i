    <div class="box">The Golden Child</div>
    <div class="stalk">The Yellow-Throated Marten <em>(Martes Flavigula)</em>populates much of Southeast and East Asia.
        Known for its sheer size and bold appearance, the Yellow-Throated Marten has become a well-known species
        in especially the Himalayan region.

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <img class="body" src="YellowImages/Yellowappearance.png">
        <p>The Yellow-Throated Marten is the largest marten species, and is known for its powerful, physical build.
            Instead of having the signature yellow bib other marten species has, the Yellow-Throated Marten is
            predominately yellow, as if its body is acting as the bib. It also has black legs and a black tail, with
            some even having white spots on their paws.</p>
        <img class="profile" src="YellowImages/Yellowprofile.png">
        <p>The Yellow-Throated Marten has a distinctly wide head, with its shorter, rounder ears making its face appear
            more dense. Despite the rest of its body being mostly yellow, the head of the Yellow-Throated Marten is
            predominately black, with a white chin that marks out its muzzle. The overall shape and layout of the face
            makes it look closer in appearance to its extened cousin, the badger.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="range">
        <h2>Range</h2>
        <p>Found along South and Southeast Asia, Yellow-Throated Martens can appear in a diverse array of habitats. Also
            nicknamed as the "Himalayan Marten" because of its range, the Yellow-Throated Marten is very flexible and
            tough, widthstanding the extreme temperatures of higher elevations and the coniferous forests.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diet">
        <p>The Yellow Throated Marten is known to be very fierce, hunting larger prey, such as deer, pheasants, monkeys,
            and even the elusive red pandas if given the chance. However, due to the opportunistic nature of martens,
            the Yellow-Throated Marten is also known for eating plants and plant-based foods, such as nectar.</p>

    <div class="behavior">
        <h2>The Fearless Weasel</h2>
        <p>The Yellow-Throated Marten is well known for its bold, yet reckless, behavior. Compared to other marten
            species, the Yellow-Throated Marten is unusually curious towards humans. This behavior may be explained by
            it being one of the top predators of the region, only being preyed on by the Siberian Tiger and Asian bears.
            Even the terrain isn't enough to slow them down. Yellow-Throated Martens can often be found swimming across
            lakes, an activity mostly found by martens that live by the coast.
